This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Use `npm run build` to build the app in the `build` folder.

Use `npm start` to run the app. It will refresh the app any time you save changes.

Port configuration:
In the package.json, under "scripts" -> "start", you can specify the port

Assumptions:
I assumed I could use create-react-app for this project, which is what I have used in the past
for any from-scratch react work.

Future work:
- Separate the count display and the incrementing button into two components
- Make it prettier, maybe use material ui, add some cow pngs
- Add tests
